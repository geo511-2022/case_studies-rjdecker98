# Introduction to problem/question
  
# Problem / Question
For my project I would like to create detailed visualizations of the spread of diabetes in the United States over the past twenty years while accounting for variables of gender and age.

# Inspiring Examples

.

## Example 1
![](https://www.5haw.com/posts/2019-07-10-week-3-making-an-animated-map-using-ggmap-and-gganimate_files/MPCmap.gif)
I found this graph very eye-catching and easy to read due to its ability to animate and show the change of exposure over time through color variety.

## Example 2
![](https://sjmgarnier.github.io/viridis/reference/figures/maps.png)
I like this graph a lot because I want to use a viridis colorway to increase the readability of the maps I intend to create. I also am considering using facets here in conjuntion with an animated map to further convey the data.
## Example 3


# Proposed data sources

Be as specific as possible.

# Proposed methods

List the approach you will use. Don't simply list packages, tell me what you will do with them.

# Expected results

Describe what you want to produce (graphics, analyses, etc.)
